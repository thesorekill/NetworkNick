# Notes:

# - Color codes use & (ex: &a, &c, &l). Hex also supported in /nick.

hide:
  # Fallback generator length for /hide when hide.nick is blank/missing.

  # If true, your UI layer (TAB/scoreboard/chat) can use placeholders to
  # conditionally remove prefixes/suffixes while hidden.

  # NOTE: This plugin does not forcibly rewrite LuckPerms prefixes by itself.
  # It's intended for conditional formatting via placeholders/config in TAB/etc.

  # Custom nickname used when a player runs /hide.
  # - If set (non-empty), this exact string is used as the hidden nick.
  # - If it does NOT start with &k, the plugin will prepend &k automatically.
  # - If blank/missing, the plugin falls back to the generator using random-length.
  #
  # Default hides as obfuscated colons:
  nick: "&k::::::::::::::"


enforce:
  # If true, the plugin will re-apply the nickname periodically for a short time
  # (or continuously depending on your implementation) to beat other plugins that
  # overwrite display names after join.
  #
  # Useful if you run chat/tab plugins that “refresh” player names later.
